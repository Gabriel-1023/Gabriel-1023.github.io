<h1 id="3-三次作业">3. 三次作业</h1>
<h2 id="作业1-自我介绍">作业1 （自我介绍）</h2>
<p>Please prepare a brief autobiography.</p>
<p>Write the autobiography in the first person with an emphasis on your educational background, achievements or professional experience, and further expectations, balanced with personal information that helps create the tone you desire to impress others.</p>
<h2 id="作业2-小组作业">作业2 （小组作业）</h2>
<p>During this course period, you will be asked to work in teams for the lab assignment. Teams will be established prior to the beginning of team assignments. Each team may have 4-8 people. Since the teamwork is the cornerstone of practical IT service world, it is important that you experience being a member of a virtual team in this collaborative learning environment, for your further adventure in the real IT service industry. Each team will discuss and work on their team assignments, which your team might then share the results with entire class.</p>
<p>See <strong><a href="https://github.com/Gabriel-1023/Basement/blob/main/%E4%BA%91%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E6%A1%88%E4%BE%8B%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90/TeamProject.doc">TeamProject.doc</a></strong></p>
<p>Among the groups, the team projects will receive grades according to the level of team effort and output significance, based on the comparison of team projects.</p>
<p>For the small group activities, I will monitor individual contributions to the team exercise. Work in the teams will be individually assessed. I mention this for clarity because, as those of you who are familiar with teamwork may know, there is always a question about whether all members of a learning team will automatically receive the same grades or whether individual scores may differ. In this class, not everyone in each learning team will receive the same assessment for the assignment -- in this case, part of the assessment will depend on individual effort. I will be looking at *<strong>individual contributions*</strong> to the team assignment as a whole, as well as the ability of each team to work together well as a *<strong>team*</strong> and not as individuals simply combining separate answers to the assignment.</p>
<h2 id="作业3-课后总结">作业3 （课后总结）</h2>
<p>Please summarize a final report on what you have individually experienced over this course.</p>
<p>Hints: You may review this course syllabus again and start to answer the questions from, but not be limited by, the follows,</p>
<p>1)Before and after this course period, what could be the difference to your understanding on the concepts of services?</p>
<p>2)What is the most impressive issue which brought your attention over this course period?</p>
<p>3)What could be the major challenge(s) in your future career development? And which pieces of information in this course might provide help to you?</p>
<p>4)Is this course fairly similar to, or significantly different from, other courses you took before? Why?</p>
<p>5)What else you might want to say to the instructor?</p>
