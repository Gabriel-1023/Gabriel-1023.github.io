<p>TCP Potpourri.</p>
<p>a. Consider two TCP connections, one between Hosts A (sender) and B (receiver), and another between Hosts C (sender) and D (receiver). The RTT between A and B is half that of the RTT between C and D. Suppose that the senders’ (A’s and C’s) congestion window sizes are identical. Is their throughput (number of segments transmitted per second) the same? Explain.</p>
<p>b. Now suppose that the average RTT between A and B, and C and D are identical. The RTT between A and B is constant (never varies), but the RTT between C and D varies considerably. Will the TCP timer values of the two connections differ, and if so, how are they different, and why are they different?</p>
<p>c. Give one reason why TCP uses a three-way (SYN, SYNACK, ACK) handshake rather than a two-way handshake to initiate a connection.</p>
<p>d. It is said that a TCP connection “probes” the network path it uses for available bandwidth. What does this mean?</p>
<p>e. What does it mean when we say that TCP uses “cumulative acknowledgement”? Give two reasons why cumulative acknowledgment is advantageous over selective acknowledgment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In chapter 2, we studied a number of multiple access protocols, including TDMA, CSMA, slotted Aloha, and token passing.</p>
<p>a. Suppose you were charged with putting together a large LAN to support IP telephony (only) and that multiple users may want to carry on a phone call at the same time. Recall that IP telephony digitizes and packetizes voice at a constant bit rate when a user is making an IP phone call. How well suited are these four protocols for this scenario? Provide a brief (one sentence) explanation of each answer.</p>
<p>b. Now suppose you were charged with putting together a LAN to support the occasional exchange of data between nodes (in this part of this question, there is no voice traffic). That is, any individual node does not have data to send very often. How well suited are these four protocols for this scenario? Provide a brief (one sentence) explanation of each answer.</p>
<p>c. Now suppose the LAN must support both voice and data and you must choose one of these multiple access strategies in order to support both applications on the same network, with the understanding that voice calls are more important than data. Which would you choose and why? How would voice and data be sent in this scenario? That is, which access protocol would you use, or adapt/modify, and why?</p>

<p>In the lecture we list a number of different services that a link layer can potentially provide to the network layer. These services include: a) framing, b) medium access, c) reliable delivery, d) flow control, e) error detection, f) error correction, g) full-duplex and half-duplex. For each of these services, discuss how or how not Ethernet provides the service.</p>

<p>Consider a packet of length L which begins at end system A, travels over one link to a packet switch, and travels from the packet switch over a second link to a destination end system. Let di, si and Ri denote the length, propagation speed, and transmission rate of link i, for i = 1, 2. The packet switch delays each packet by dproc. Assuming no queuing delays, in terms of di, si, Ri, (i = 1, 2) and L, what is the total end-to-end delay for the packet? Suppose the packet is 1,000 bytes, the propagation speed on both links is 2.5 * 108 m/s the transmission rates of both links is 1 Mbps, the packet switch processing delay is 1 msec, the length of the first link is 4,000 km, and the length of the last link is 1,000 km. For these values, what is the end-to-end delay?</p>
<p>Suppose R1=R2=R and dproc = 0.Furthermore, suppose the packet switch does not store-and-forward packets but instead immediately transmits each bit it receives before waiting for the packet to arrive. What is the end-to-end delay?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider sending a packet of F bits over a path of Q links. Each link transmits at <em>R</em> bps. The network is lightly loaded so that there are no queuing delays. Propagation delay is also negligible.</p>
<p>a. Suppose the network is a packet-switched datagram network and a connection-oriented service is used. Suppose each packet has h * F bits of header where 0 &lt; h &lt; 1. Assuming ts setup time, how long does it take to send the packet?</p>
<p>b. Suppose that the network is a circuit-switched network. Furthermore, suppose that the transmission rate of the circuit between source and destination is <em>R</em>/24 bps. Assuming ts setup time and no bits of header appended to the packet, how long does it take to send the packet?</p>
<p>c. When is the delay longer for packet switching than for circuit switching assuming h=0.5. Interpret your result?</p>
